Working on SWE 432 Project

## Deliverables

For the next phase, we will begin building out our web sites in an incremental, iterative approach. The first round will focus on the core screens for each role to perform their functions while also providing a platform for future JavaScript and server-side interactions. The grading is designed to guide this process - get the baseline HTML developed on your page (forms, tables, labels, etc.) , add in some basic CSS, and then add in more CSS (grids and FlexBoxes).   All the elements are required in order to get full credit as seen in the rubric.
Individual Grading:
- Core HTML:  50 points (includes basic elements and structure plus HTML5, list, table, form and validation)
- Basic CSS:   30 (includes styling with colors and fonts plus selectors and specificity)
- More CSS:    10 (includes flexbox, grid or box plus appropriate use of inline, internal and external styles)
- Role Based: 10 (includes sufficient screen(s) to get started with explanation of their use)
There is no group grading for this iteration. If you use a common CSS file, please label it as groupxx.css The assessment is focused on individual web page development although the group should maintain a common look and feel. We will assess the group CSS and overall implementation in a later iteration.

Submission Format: All students are required to submit their source code files via a GitHub repository. Please send a GitHub invite for your repository to the GTA as part of the submission process.

Output Document: Along with the link to your code, please prepare an output document containing screenshots of your screens. This will help in quickly assessing the visual aspects of your work.

Self-Evaluation: As part of your submission include a detailed self-evaluation document assessing your work based on the rubric points. For each rubric item, students must indicate the points they believe they've earned and a statement indicating how the requirement was satisfied. The document must follow the rubric outline plus be well-organized, clear, and concise.  Your self-evaluation will provide insight into your understanding of the project requirements and your own performance.

Note on Core Screens: By "core screens", we meant the essential screen(s) required for each interface to function properly. Depending on the complexity and functionality required for each user profile, this may be covered using one primary (or core) screen. Depending on your UI design, there might be a need for multiple core screens per role. We may not need every screen from your UI design done so please provide the most important screens necessary to build out your capabilities.

Note: Students must ensure all submitted links are accessible and that files can be viewed/downloaded as necessary. Any issues with access or visibility could impact grading. If any of the required documents are missing, your submission will be considered incomplete and will not be graded. Any missing rubric line items or associated screen shot will result in a zero for that line item.
